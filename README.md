# ðŸŽ¥ MovieLens Rating Prediction Project

Welcome to the **MovieLens Rating Prediction Project**, an in-depth analysis and predictive modeling initiative leveraging the MovieLens 10M dataset. This repository includes an R Markdown report (`Movielens_report.Rmd`) and a companion R script (`Movielens_analysis.R`) to explore, process, and model movie ratings.

## ðŸ“š Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting movie ratings based on user behavior and movie characteristics. By achieving accurate predictions, this model serves as the foundational step for personalized movie recommendation systems used by platforms like Netflix and Hulu.

### Highlights:
- Utilized **Gaussian Elastic Net Regression** to model continuous ratings.
- Engineered features from raw data, such as movie release decade, user rating trends, and genre distributions.
- Evaluated model performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
